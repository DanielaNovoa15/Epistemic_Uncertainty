# Building Data Analysis Repository

This repository contains data and analysis scripts used for a study on buildings with different numbers of stories, as detailed in the accompanying article. There are three main directories, each corresponding to the building stories analyzed:

- `3F_Building` - Data for the 3-story building
- `4F_Building` - Data for the 4-story building
- `14F_Building` - Data for the 14-story building

## Common Contents in Each Directory

Each folder contains the following files and directories:

1. **FEMA-P695 Records:** 44 ground motion records named from `GM01` to `GM44`.
2. **00_Espectro:** A Python script that generates the design spectrum based on the seismic hazard zone where the analyzed building was constructed.
3. **00_Secciones:** A Python script that includes the fiber sections of the building used for modeling. It stores the configuration of beams and columns used in the modeling process.
4. **00_SpectrumFactor:** This script generates a list of spectral factors for each building.
5. **analisis:** A library file used for conducting gravity analysis, pushover analysis, and dynamic and IDA analyses.
6. **NewmarkL:** A library file that includes a function for calculating the acceleration of non-structural components.
7. **utilidades:** A library file containing various functions used to generate the model or archetype of each building.
8. **Pickle Files:** Contains 5 pickle files with data on Sa and the period of the FEMA records, and the values Aa, Av, Fa, and Fv dictated by the Colombian NSR-10 standard for seismic hazard calculation.

Additionally, each directory contains specific files named with a prefix like `01_`, `02_`, and so on, which are described below:

- **01_\<BuildingName\>:** The archetype of the building. This file includes the building model but does not generate any results.
- **02_Pushover:** Used to generate the pushover analysis of the building. Running this script in the console yields the capacity curve.
- **03_Dinamico:** Conducts dynamic analysis of the structure with the 44 FEMA records using Monte Carlo simulations. Running this script generates a pickle file with all the data.
- **04_ProbFallaDef:** Generates the probability of exceedance of damage states for each building. The charts generated are those used in the article.
- **05_FA-FINAL:** Produces all results regarding floor accelerations and component accelerations.

**Note:** The pickle files generated by the dynamic analysis scripts are not included in the repository due to their large size, as they encompass over 55 GB across three buildings, with 300 different models for each building and 44 records.
